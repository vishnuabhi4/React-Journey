* React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while ViteReact refers to using React as the framework within the Vite development environment. Vite is an excellent choice for React development due to its speed and developer-friendly features, making it a popular combination for modern web application development.
* `export default FunctionName`  exports the Journey component as the default export of this module. It allows you to import and use the `FunctonName` component in other parts of your application as the default export.
* `function FunctonName() { ... }`: This code defines the FunctonName component as a functional component. It's a basic React component that returns JSX (JavaScript XML), which represents the UI for your component.
* The `rootElement` in a React application can be visualized as the entry point or container in your HTML document where your entire React application will be rendered. It's like the soil in which you plant your React tree, allowing it to grow and expand throughout your web page.
